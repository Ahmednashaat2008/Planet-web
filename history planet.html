    <div class="h.p"><p>The concept of planets has changed throughout history, from divine lights to scientifically studied objects. There is still debate over what qualifies as a planet versus other celestial bodies. The classical planets, visible to the naked eye, have been known since ancient times and have influenced mythology and astronomy. In ancient civilizations, it was believed that Earth was the center of the Universe and that all planets orbited around it, due to the apparent daily motion of stars and planets around Earth and the perception of Earth as stable and motionless.</p>

    <h2>Babylon</h2>

    <p>

        The Babylonians were the first civilization to develop a functional theory of the planets. The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, a copy of a list of observations of the motions of the planet Venus that dates back to the second millennium BC. The MUL.APIN is a pair of cuneiform tablets dating from the 7th century BC that lays out the motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets over the course of the year. Late Babylonian astronomy is the origin of Western astronomy and all Western efforts in the exact sciences. The Enuma anu enlil, written during the Neo-Assyrian period in the 7th century BC, comprises a list of omens and their relationships with various celestial phenomena, including the motions of the planets. Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were all identified by Babylonian astronomers and remained the only known planets until the invention of the telescope in early modern times.

    <h2>Greco-Roman astronomy</h2>
    <p>The Greeks had a different view of the planets than the Babylonians, with Pythagoras and Parmenides developing their own theory of the Earth, Sun, Moon, and planets revolving around a "Central Fire" at the center of the Universe. Aristarchus of Samos proposed a heliocentric system in the 3rd century BC, but the geocentric system remained dominant until the Scientific Revolution. During the Hellenistic period, the Greeks developed mathematical schemes for predicting the positions of the planets, based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the Babylonians. These schemes would eventually surpass the Babylonians' theories in complexity and comprehensiveness, and account for most of the astronomical movements observed from Earth with the naked eye. The Greeks and Romans recognized seven known planets, each presumed to be circling Earth according to the complex laws laid out by Ptolemy: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. These theories would reach their fullest expression in the Almagest written by Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE.

    <h2>Medieval astronomy</h2>
    <p>After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, astronomy continued to develop in India and the medieval Islamic world. In 499 CE, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata proposed a planetary model that incorporated Earth's rotation about its axis, which he explained as the cause of the apparent westward motion of the stars. Aryabhata also theorized that the orbits of planets were elliptical. His followers were particularly strong in South India, where his principles were followed and secondary works were based on them.

        During the Islamic Golden Age, which took place in the Middle East, Central Asia, Al-Andalus, and North Africa, astronomers generally accepted geocentrism, although they disputed Ptolemy's system of epicycles and sought alternatives. The 10th-century astronomer Abu Sa'id al-Sijzi accepted that the Earth rotates around its axis. In the 11th century, the transit of Venus was observed by Avicenna, and his contemporary Al-Biruni devised a method of determining the Earth's radius using trigonometry that required observations at a single mountain, unlike the older method of Eratosthenes.</p>

    <h2>Scientific Revolution and new planets</h2>
    <p>The meaning of the term "planet" changed from a celestial body that moved around the sky relative to a fixed star to a body that orbited the Sun, either directly or indirectly. The discovery of Jupiter's and Saturn's satellites caused scientists to consider them as secondary planets until the 1920s. In the 19th century, four new planets were discovered, but they were different from previously known planets because they were much smaller and shared the same space as other celestial bodies in the asteroid belt. They were eventually called asteroids and were tabulated separately from major planets. Neptune was discovered in 1846, and the discovery of additional asteroids led astronomers to assign them numbers instead of abstract planetary symbols. Finally, the discrepancy between Mercury's orbit and the predictions of Newtonian gravity was explained by Einstein's theory of general relativity.</p>
